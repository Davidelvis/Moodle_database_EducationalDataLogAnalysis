# Moodle Database Educational Data Log Analysis
The Moodle LMS  is a free and open-source learning management system written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors. With customizable management features, it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals. Moodle allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community-sourced plugins.
In 2019, 10 Academy used the Moodle LMS to manage about 1000 students in their 6 months data science training. Learners, course instructors, and all admins interacted with the Moodle system for almost all the training activities. All events from these activities are logged in the moodle postgres database.
